CS 456 – Web Programming (Spring 2026)

### Assignment
The students must assemble into groups of up to two people (it is ok to do it alone),
henceforth called Team. Choose your team well, as you will be working with the same person for
all the remaining web project assignments in this course.
Your team must come up with a project for a web application. This project will be
improved throughout the course; therefore, it is your team’s responsibility to assure the safety
of your files for future assignments. You can be as imaginative as you want with the project, just
make sure it is a web application that will require coding and data managing. Your team will not
need to develop everything in your project, this is just to see if your team can make an overall
plan for the software.
For the project definition, you should create a PDF document with the following topics:
• The Name of your application
• GitHub repository link
• Members of your team (including yourself)
• General Description of the application you plan to develop.
• Target audience
Your team will need to implement the main page for your proposed application. Please,
note that the main page is not always the “first page”. The main page should contain links (usually
as a horizontal or vertical menu/navbar) to the most important parts of your web site. The main
page is the central hub for your application. The quality of the page layout and coloring will be
evaluated. Your web page cannot be “blank”, try to fill it up with images and at the very least
dummy text (e.g., lorem ipsum …).
Your main page must use Bootstrap to create a responsive design. Your page should at
least adapt and change for extra small devices, and medium devices.
Create a GitHub repository to store artifacts related to your web application (namely the
main page and its auxiliary files). Just one repository per team, be sure to add all team members
to it, and give access to the professor (Git id: “hscrocha”). Please, don’t forget to include the link
for your GitHub repository in the project definition.
In the Moodle entry, you just need to submit the PDF with the project definition. Any
questions, issues, or concerns, please contact the professor as soon as possible.
